      HTML Paragraphs HTML paragraphs are a fundamental element for organizing
      and displaying textual content on web pages. By using them correctly and
      adhering to best practices, you can enhance the structure, readability,
      and accessibility of your web content. The p tag defines a paragraph in
      HTML. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically
      add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. HTML
      paragraphs adapt to different screen sizes and resized windows. You cannot
      change their display by adding extra spaces or lines in your HTML code;
      browsers automatically remove any extra spaces and lines.
